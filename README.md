## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The rapid growth of short-form video consumption underscores the need for a next-generation paradigm in video generation.  
This repository provides the implementation of **IaVNG**, a two-stage model designed for **League of Legends (LoL)** gameplay videos:

1. **Key Interaction Segment (KIS) Module**  
   - Extracts dense and meaningful interaction segments using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).  
   - Interaction logs (e.g., champion kills, dragon/baron objectives) are detected via YOLOv5-based models.  

2. **Narrative Generation (NG) Module**  
   - Generates coherent short-form narratives grounded in the selected KIS.  
   - Combines visual features and commentary text via cross-attention and LSTM decoding.

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset
- Based on **LoL Champions Korea (LCK)** 2023â€“2024 Spring and Summer splits.  
- 952 match videos (~570 hours, 1080p 59.94fps).  
- 25,120 timestamped commentary sentences (transcribed & anonymized).  
- Key interaction logs include **CHAMPION_KILL** and **OBJECT_KILL** events.  

---

## ðŸ§ª Experimental Results
- **Interaction Log Detection**: 96.71% Precision, 97.08% Recall, 96.90% F1-score.  
- **Narrative Generation**: Outperforms baselines on METEOR (+1.33) and ROUGE-L (+2.06).  
- Qualitative results show IaVNG produces **context-aware and coherent commentary** for short-form content.
